# Dice_thrower
This is a basically dice throwing app in which two dice are being thrown. The App can be modified as per the need. This app basically implements the use of stateful widgets(where the state is being changes),
It successfully incorporated the use of expanded class, whose main task is to fill the space, when mobile/device is tilted. The Basic implementation of dart function is also incorporated into the project.
